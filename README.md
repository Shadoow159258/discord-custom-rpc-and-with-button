This guide explains how to make a custom RPC status on Discord!

### Requirements
* You must be logged in to a Discord client in your desktop, so no mobile or web
* You need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or another code editor
* You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (includes NPM, which is needed as well)

## Step One: Make the application
* Go to the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) > New Application
* Give it the name you want your RPC status to have
* Under the tab Rich Presence > Art Assets, upload an image (if you want one) and note the name

## Step Two: Creating the project
* Make a new folder and open it in your code editor
* Open a terminal in your project's folder and initialize the project with `npm init -y` (if it gives an error run the interactive setup with `npm init`)
* Install the `discord-rpc` package: `npm install discord-rpc`
* Now, make an `index.js` file and put the following in:
```js
const RPC = require('discord-rpc');
const client = new RPC.Client({
    transport: 'ipc'
});

client.on('ready', () => {
    client.request('SET_ACTIVITY', {
        pid: process.pid,
        activity: {
            details: "Details Here",
            state: "State Here",
            timestamps: {
                start: Date.now()
            },
            assets: {
                large_image: "", // large image key from developer portal > rich presence > art assets
                large_text: "large image text"
            },
            buttons: [
                { label: "Label1", url: "URL1" },
                { label: "Label2", url: "URL2" }
            ]
        }
    });
});

client.login({
    clientId: '', // put the client id from the dev portal here
    clientSecret: '' // put the client secret from the dev portal here
});
```

## Step Three: Running the RPC
* Save all files, then run `node index.js` in the terminal
* It should log that it's ready, and the RPC status should appear on your profile!

## Custom RPC's
* NOTE : you need to install `npm install discordrpcgenerator` for using rpc mentioned below ðŸ‘‡ 

* Normal rpc 
Code 
```js
let  discord  = require ( " discord.js " ) 
let  rpcGenerator  = require ( " discordrpcgenerator " ) 
var uuid = ( ) => ( [ 1e7 ] + - 1e3 + - 4e3 + - 8e3 + - 1e11 ) . replace ( / [ 018 ] / g , a => ( a ^ Math . random ( ) * 16 >> a / 4 ) . toString ( 16 ) ) //    or require ("uuid / v4")
let  client  = new discord . Customer ( )  
 
client . login ( " your token " )
 
client . on ( " ready " , ( ) => {   
    rpcGenerator . getRpcImage ( " 383226320970055681 " , " js " ) 
    . then ( image =>  { 
        let  presence  = new rpcGenerator . Rpc ( )  
        . setName ( " My rpc " )
        . setUrl ( " https://twitch.tv/discord " )
        . setType ( " STREAMING " )
        . setApplicationId ( " 383226320970055681 " )
        . setAssetsLargeImage ( image . id )
        . setAssetsLargeText ( image . name )
        . setDetails ( " : pasdechance: " )
        . setState ( " Waaaaaw " )
        . setParty ( {
            size : [ 1 , 4 ] ,  
            id : uuid ( ) 
        } )
        . setDetails ( " d4rk " )
 
        client . wear out . setPresence ( presence . toDiscord ( ) )
    } ) . catch ( console . error )
} )
```
